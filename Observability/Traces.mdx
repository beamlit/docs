Deploying and running agents on Beamlit gives you **total observability by design**, without needing to install any additional library. When you either deploy from the console’s low-code builder or by using the Beamlit SDK to wrap your code for deployment, Beamlit will automatically implement logging & tracing on your requests.

## **Monitor from the Beamlit console**

There are three ways you can observe and monitor your running agents:

- Metrics
- Logs
- Traces

### **Metrics**

Metrics are aggregated data about your agents’ executions. They include:

- Number and rate of requests
- End-to-end latency: average, p50, p90, p99
- Number of tokens generated by model APIs: input, output and total
- City and country of origin of all requests

### **Logs**

Logs are timestamped data about what happens with your agents, functions and model APIs. Such data includes:

- Status of all requests on agents, functions and model APIs
- Logs generated when building your deployments
- Custom logs generated by your agents and functions

### **Traces**

Tracing helps you understand how your agent works by showing you all its parts in action. When you make a request, it creates a trace that contains multiple *spans*.

Think of a span as a building block - it shows when something starts and ends, what went in, what came out, and other useful details. Spans can contain other spans, like when one function calls another. You'll often see spans for things like LLM calls, tool calls, or steps in an agent's process. You can click on any trace to see all its spans laid out clearly. This makes it much easier to follow how your agent works and fix any problems you find.

Beamlit collects and saves the traces of a **sampled 10%** of all your executions. In order to force saving the trace on an execution, call the run API and add query parameter <debug:true>.

### **Connect to third-party tools**

Beamlit uses the OpenTelemetry standard for all the logging and tracing. We can export metrics easily to any compatible third-party platform, such as Datadog, Langfuse or others. Exporting metrics outside of Beamlit requires being in the Enterprise plan.

description: 'Ship agents in any Python/TypeScript framework on Beamlit.'

Beamlit is not tied to a specific framework but rather supports a **range of the most popular AI agent frameworks**, optimizing how your agent builds and runs no matter how you coded it. Note that in addition to supported frameworks, Beamlit also supports a wide range of [integrations](../Integrations), allowing you to connect your agents with many systems at runtime. This section covers development frameworks used to create the agent.

Beamlit’s development paradigm is designed to have a minimal footprint on your usual development process. Your custom code remains platform-agnostic: you can deploy it on Beamlit or through traditional methods like Docker containers on VMs or Kubernetes clusters. When you deploy on Beamlit (CLI command `bl deploy`), Beamlit runs a specialized build process that integrates your code with its [Global Inference Network](../Models/Global-Inference-Network) features.

As such, you can build your agentic applications with anything from LangChain to pure TypeScript, and deploy them with minimal upfront configuration. Learn how to [get started with Beamlit](../Get-started) or clone one of [our example repos](https://github.com/beamlit/templates/tree/main) to your favorite git provider and deploy it on Beamlit.

Beamlit can **integrate with your git provider** to build and deploy new revisions for each pull request you make to your project.

Deploying on Beamlit with one of our supported frameworks gives you access to many features, such as:

- **Global Inference Network:** Deploy your agents and tools across multiple locations for lowest latency and highest availability, with smart global placement of workflows.
- **Model API Gateway:** Access multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, MistralAI, etc.) through a unified gateway with centralized credentials and observability.
- **Agentics Observability:** Track agent traces, request latencies, and comprehensive metrics through our observability suite.
- **Governance Policies:** Define and enforce rules for deployment locations or token usage limits across your infrastructure.
- **Git Integration:** Automatically build and deploy new revisions for each pull request in your project.
- **Rich Integrations:** Connect your agents to 70+ various services and APIs including Slack, GitHub, or databases while keeping credentials secure.

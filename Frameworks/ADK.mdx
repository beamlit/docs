<Warning>Google ADK has a [known open issue](https://github.com/google/adk-python/issues/153) where tool calling will sometimes **not work** with models other than Gemini models.</Warning>

You can deploy your [Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://github.com/google/adk-python/tree/main) projects to Blaxel with minimal code edition (and zero configuration), enabling you to useÂ [Serverless Deployments](../Infrastructure/Global-Inference-Network%2013847e47b1ea8199a2b3fa9c62f9e09e),Â [Agentic Observability](https://www.notion.so/Traces-18f47e47b1ea80e29594f9fd7e5a117e?pvs=21),Â [Policies](../Model-Governance/Policies), and more.

## Get started with ADK on Blaxel

To get started with ADK on Blaxel:

- if you already have a ADK agent, adapt your code with [Blaxel SDK commands](../Agents/Develop-an-agent%2015a47e47b1ea808fa98bdf4f8fde8fce) to connect to [MCP servers](../Functions/Overview%2015347e47b1ea8038813fef14c49dfd5e), [LLMs](../Models/Overview%2015347e47b1ea80f48cbcd345aafd924a) and [other agents](../Agents/Overview).
- else initialize an example project with ADK by using the following Blaxel CLI command and selecting the *Google ADK hello world:*

```bash
bl create-agent-app myagent
```

[Deploy](../Agents/Deploy-an-agent) it by running:

```bash
bl deploy
```

## Develop a ADK agent using Blaxel features

While building your agent in ADK, use Blaxel SDK to connect to resources already hosted on Blaxel:

- [MCP servers](../Functions/Overview)
- [LLMs](../Models/Overview)
- [other agents](../Agents/Overview)

### Connect to MCP servers

Connect to [MCP servers](../Functions/Overview) using the Blaxel SDK to access pre-built or custom tool servers hosted on Blaxel. This eliminates the need to manage server connections yourself, with credentials stored securely on the platform.

Run the following command to retrieve tools in ADK format:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python

from blaxel.tools import bl_tools

await bl_tools(['mcp-server-name']).to_google_adk()

```

</CodeGroup>

### Connect to LLMs

Connect to [LLMs](../Models/Overview) hosted on Blaxel using the SDK to avoid managing model API connections yourself. All credentials remain securely stored on the platform.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python

from blaxel.models import bl_model

model = await bl_model("model-api-name").to_google_adk()

```

</CodeGroup>

### Connect to other agents

Connect to other agents hosted on Blaxel from your code by using the Blaxel SDK. This allows for multi-agent chaining without managing connections yourself. This command is independent of the framework used to build the agent.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python

from blaxel.agents import bl_agent

response = await bl_agent("agent-name").run(input);

```

</CodeGroup>

### Host your agent on Blaxel

You can [deploy](../Agents/Deploy-an-agent%2018c47e47b1ea80658f94d9c463f5b493) your agent on Blaxel, enabling you to useÂ [Serverless Deployments](../Infrastructure/Global-Inference-Network%2013847e47b1ea8199a2b3fa9c62f9e09e),Â [Agentic Observability](../Observability/Overview%201ab47e47b1ea80ca9331cc0a52906854),Â [Policies](../Model-Governance/Policies), and more. This command is independent of the framework used to build the agent.

Either run the following CLI command from the root of your agent repository.

```bash
bl deploy
```

Or connect a GitHub repository to Blaxel for automatic deployments every time you push on *main*.

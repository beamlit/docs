title: 'Query an agent'

description: 'Make inference requests on your agents.'

---

Agent [deployments](Overview) on Blaxel have a default **inference endpoint** which can be used by external consumers to request an inference execution. This inference endpoint is synchronous so the connection remains open until the end of your request is entirely processed by the agent. You can also query an asynchronous endpoint for agents, allowing to send requests that last for longer times without keeping connections open.

All inference requests are routed on the [Global Agentics Network](../Infrastructure/Global-Inference-Network) based on the [deployment policies](../Model-Governance/Policies) associated with your agent deployment. 

## Inference endpoints

### Default synchronous endpoint

When you deploy an agent on Blaxel, an **inference endpoint** is automatically generated on Global Agentics Network. This endpoint operates synchronously—keeping the connection open until your agent sends its complete response. Your agent's code must handle either batch or streaming processing on this endpoint.

The inference URL looks like this:

```http Query agent

POST https://run.blaxel.ai/{YOUR-WORKSPACE}/agents/{YOUR-AGENT}

```

### Async endpoint

In addition to the default synchronous endpoint, Blaxel provides the ability to create **asynchronous endpoints** for handling longer-running agent requests.

This endpoint allows you to initiate requests without maintaining an open connection throughout the entire processing duration, making it particularly useful for complex or time-intensive operations that might exceed typical connection timeouts. Blaxel handles queuing and execution behind the scene. **You are responsible for implementing your own method for retrieving the agent's results in your code**.

The timeout duration for this endpoint is **15 minutes**. If your request processing is expected to take longer than this, you should use [batch jobs](../Jobs/Overview) instead.

The async endpoint looks like this:

```http Query agent (async)

POST https://run.blaxel.ai/{YOUR-WORKSPACE}/agents/{YOUR-AGENT}/async

```

### Endpoint authentication

By default, agents deployed on Blaxel aren’t public. It is necessary to authenticate all inference requests, via a [bearer token](../Security/Access-tokens).

The evaluation of authentication/authorization for inference requests is managed by the Global Agentics Network based on the [access given in your workspace](../Security/Workspace-access-control).

<Info>Making an agent publicly available is not yet available. Please contact us at [support@blaxel.ai](mailto:support@blaxel.ai) if this is something that you need today.</Info>

### Manage sessions

To simulate multi-turn conversations, you can include a thread ID in your agent request header. You'll need to generate this ID and pass it using either `X-Blaxel-Thread-Id` or `Thread-Id`. Without a thread ID, the agent won't maintain nor use any conversation memory when processing the request.

## Make an inference request

### Blaxel API

Make a **POST** request to the default inference endpoint for the agent deployment you are requesting, making sure to fill in the authentication token:

```
curl 'https://run.blaxel.ai/YOUR-WORKSPACE/agents/YOUR-AGENT?environment=YOUR-ENVIRONMENT' \
  -H 'accept: application/json, text/plain, */*' \
  -H 'X-Blaxel-Authorization: Bearer YOUR-TOKEN' \
  -H 'X-Blaxel-Workspace: YOUR-WORKSPACE' \
  --data-raw $'{"inputs":"Enter your input here."}'
```

Read about [the API parameters in the reference](https://docs.blaxel.ai/api-reference/inference).

### Blaxel CLI

The following command will make a default POST request to the agent.

```bash
bl run agent your-agent --data '{"inputs":"Enter your input here."}'
```

Read about [the CLI parameters in the reference](https://docs.blaxel.ai/cli-reference/bl_run).

### Blaxel console

Inference requests can be made from the Blaxel console from the agent deployment’s **Playground** page.

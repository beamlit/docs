title: 'Variables and secrets'

description: 'Manage variables and secrets in your agent or MCP server code.'

---

Environment variables are retrieved first from your `.env` file, and if not found there, from the `[env]` section of `blaxel.toml`. This fallback mechanism allows for two kinds of variables:

- simple environment variables
- secrets

## Variables

You can define variables inside your agent or MCP server in the `blaxel.toml` file at root level of your project. These variables are NOT intended to be use as secrets, but as configuration variables.

```toml blaxel.toml {6}

name = "..."
workspace = "..."
type = "function"

[env]
DEFAULT_CITY = "San Francisco"

```

You can then use it in your code with the `env.DEFAULT_CITY` variable.

<CodeGroup>

```typescript TypeScript

process.env.DEFAULT_CITY

```

```python Python

import os

os.environ.get('DEFAULT_CITY')

```

</CodeGroup>

## Secrets

You can create a file named `.env` at the root level of your project to store your secrets. The `.env` file should be added to your `.gitignore` file to prevent committing these sensitive variables.

```
MY_SECRET_VARIABLE=mySecretValue
```

You can then use secrets in your code with the `env.MY_SECRET_VARIABLE` variable.

## Reserved variables

The following variables are reserved by Blaxel:

`PORT`: Reserved by the system.

`BL_SERVER_PORT` : Port of the HTTP server, it need to be set to allow Blaxel platform to configure it

`BL_SERVER_HOST` : Host of the HTTP server, it need to be set to allow Blaxel platform to configure it

Internal URL for Blaxel platform, to avoid linking multiple instance through the Internet

`BL_AGENT_${envVar}_SERVICE_NAME`

`BL_FUNCTION_${envVar}_SERVICE_NAME`

`BL_RUN_INTERNAL_HOSTNAME`: internal run url

Override URL to link multiple agents and MCP servers together locally

`BL_AGENT_${envVar}_URL`

`BL_FUNCTION_${envVar}_URL`

Metadata automatically set by blaxel platform in production

`BL_WORKSPACE` : workspace name

`BL_NAME` : name of the function or the agent

`BL_TYPE` : function or agent

Authentication environment variables

`BL_CLIENT_CREDENTIALS` : client credentials, used by Blaxel in production with a workspaced service account

`BL_API_KEY` : can be set in your code to connect with the platform (locally or from a server not on Blaxel platform)

`BL_LOG_LEVEL` : Log level, default to info, can be set to debug,warn,error

`BL_DEBUG_TELEMETRY`: Enable telemetry debug mode, will print each interaction with OpenTelemetry

`BL_ENABLE_OPENTELEMETRY`: Enable OpenTelemetry, it's set automatically by the platform in production

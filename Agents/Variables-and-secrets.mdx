## Variables

You can define variables inside your agent or MCP server in the `blaxel.toml` file at root level of your project. These variables are NOT intended to be use as secrets, but as configuration variables.

```toml
name = "..."
workspace = "..."
type = "function"

[env]
DEFAULT_CITY = "San Francisco"
```

You can then use it in your code with the `env.DEFAULT_CITY` variable.

```
const { env } = require("@blaxel/sdk");
const myVariable = env.DEFAULT_CITY;
```

## Secrets

You can create a file named `.env` at the root level of your project to store your secrets. The `.env` file should be added to your `.gitignore` file to prevent committing these sensitive variables.

```
MY_SECRET_VARIABLE=mySecretValue
```

You can then use secrets in your code with the `env.MY_SECRET_VARIABLE` variable.

```
const { env } = require("@blaxel/sdk");
const mySecretVariable = env.MY_SECRET_VARIABLE;
```

Agents are AI-powered systems that are able to interact with their consumers, reason, and autonomously take action on the external world via APIs to read or write data. 

## Beamlit concepts

There are three types of workloads that you can deploy on Beamlit:

- **Functions**: These are pieces of custom code that can be executed with specific arguments through an API endpoint. They represent the tools that an agent can use to interact with the environment.
    - *When you deploy a function on Beamlit, you get a global endpoint to run the function in a sandboxed environment. It can retrieve integration connections in order to access private systems (such as a database).*
- **Model APIs**: These are the APIs to ML models that make inferences as part of the chained AI workflow. They typically represent action models: LLMs that can interact with humans in natural language and decide to use a tool at their disposal, generating the payload to use as the tool input (*function calling*)
    - *When you deploy a model API on Beamlit, you get a global endpoint to call the model provider from a unified interface that handles credentials management for you via saved integration connections.*
- **Agents**: These are files of custom code which represents an agent’s logic, dictating which functions and models it can use, as well as which agents it is allowed to transfer a request to.
    - *When you deploy an agent on Beamlit, you get a global endpoint to run the agent in a secure sandboxed environment. Agent-type workloads handle all communication with their functions, model APIs, and other linked agents — making sure all requests are authenticated against the end-user’s identity and access rights. Agents also provide complete lineage and audit tracking of consumer requests across all workloads.*

This is a high-level representation, as ultimately an entire AI agent is simply just software, but Beamlit helps you design your agent in a future-proof way by breaking it down into a function, model API and agent logic. 

Beamlit provides all the **developer tools** needed to build and run your agents throughout their lifecycle. When pushed to Beamlit, agents, models, and functions become available as single **global endpoints**. Beamlit not only lets you specify the model APIs and tools an agent uses during development but also **executes those API and tool calls** during agent runtime. You can manage your model lifecycle across stages using Beamlit environments such as development and production, in order to iterate on prompts and code, and ship and rollback as needed. 

## Run your agent on Beamlit

To run your agent on Beamlit, you must package it by **using the Beamlit SDK**. This packaging is agnostic of the framework you used to develop your agent and doesn’t prevent you from deploying your software elsewhere. The Beamlit SDK allows Beamlit to identify core resources in your code, so they can be adequately created when launching a deployment on Beamlit.

## Agent reference

### Action model

You must choose one action model, which will be the reasoning and talking core of the agent. The model must be a model API deployed on Beamlit, either a [custom model deployment](../Models/Model-deployment%2013847e47b1ea8103a274c27cff3de584) or an [external model API](../Models/External-model-apis). 

### Functions

Select one or multiple [functions](../Functions/Overview) to equip your agent with the ability to run custom code. This is optional, in which case your agent will only be able to talk.

### Chaining and multi-agents

Multi-agent systems allow to better specialize each agent, with their specific set of tools and instructions. 

You can chain other agents to an agent on Beamlit. When processing a consumer query, the agent will be able to handover the request to another agent that is chained to it if the action model considers it the best way to address the query.

### Environment

Select the environment on which to deploy your agent, just like you would do for a model. Environments give you a dedicated production or development endpoint for your application life-cycle.

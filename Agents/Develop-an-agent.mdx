You can **bring agents developed in any framework** (LangChain, CrewAI, or any custom framework in Python) and deploy them on Blaxel by integrating a few lines of the Blaxel SDK and leveraging our other developer tools ([Blaxel CLI](../cli-reference), GitHub action, etc.).

To run your agent on Blaxel, you must package it by **using the Blaxel SDK** so Blaxel can identify the [core resources to deploy](Overview): the main agent code, the standalone tools/functions it can use, and the model APIs it can query. This is what allows Blaxel to enable its features when your agent is deployed, such as secure connections to third-party systems or private networks, smart global placement of workflows, and much more.

## Overview of the development/deployment process

Blaxel’s development paradigm is designed to have a minimal footprint on your usual development process. Your custom code remains platform-agnostic: you can deploy it on Blaxel or through traditional methods like Docker containers on VMs or Kubernetes clusters. When you deploy on Blaxel (CLI command `bl deploy`), Blaxel runs a specialized build process that integrates your code with its [Global Inference Network](../Models/Global-Inference-Network) features.

<Warning>At this time, Blaxel only supports custom agents developed in TypeScript or Python.</Warning>

Here is a high-level presentation of how agents can be built and deployed using Blaxel:

1. **Initialize a new project by creating a local git repository**. This will contain your agent's logic, custom functions, and API connections, as well as all required dependencies. For quick setup, use [Blaxel CLI](../cli-reference) command `bl create-agent-app`, which creates a pre-scaffolded local repository ready for developing and deploying your agent on Blaxel.
2. **Develop and test your agent iteratively in a local environment**. 
    1. Develop your agent logic using an agentic framework (like LangChain) or any custom TypeScript/Python code. Write your own functions. Use Blaxel SDK wrappers and decorators on your core agent and functions to specify the resources to run on Blaxel.
    2. Use Blaxel CLI command `bl serve` to serve your agent on your local machine and get an endpoint for inference requests. The execution workflow—including agent logic, functions, and model API calls—is broken down and sandboxed exactly as it would be when served on Blaxel.
3. **Deploy your agent**. Use Blaxel CLI command `bl deploy` to build and deploy your agent on Blaxel. You can manage a development & production life-cycle by deploying multiple agents, with the according prefix or label.

<Note>See an example of [how to use the Blaxel SDK to develop and deploy a custom LangChain agent](../Examples/Deploy-a-LangChain-agent) in 5 minutes.</Note>

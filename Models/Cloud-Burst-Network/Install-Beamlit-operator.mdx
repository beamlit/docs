description: 'Manage Beamlit resources from your Kubernetes cluster with the Beamlit controller.'

<Tip>The Beamlit controller's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/beamlit/beamlit-controller/) provides comprehensive instructions for installing and using the open-source controller. For a step-by-step Helm installation, read the following documentation.</Tip>

The **open-source Beamlit controller** allows to remotely create and control objects (such as models) on a destination cluster. The destination cluster can be [Beamlit Global Inference Network](../Global-Inference-Network) or any of your Kubernetes clusters. The Beamlit controller can also **monitor the health** of any AI app deployed in your cluster. A Beamlit gateway (installed in your cluster alongside the controller) [load-balances requests](Model-overflow) between your deployment and the one in the destination when needed.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following:

1. **A Kubernetes Cluster**: A running Kubernetes cluster (version 1.27 or later is recommended). You can use managed services like [Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/), [Google GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine), [Azure AKS](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/kubernetes-service/), or set up your own cluster.
2. **kubectl**: Installed and configured to interact with your Kubernetes cluster. [Installation Guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/).

1. **Helm**. Version 3.8.0 or later is recommended in order to use [OCI-based registries](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/registries/). Check out the [Installation Guide.](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
1. A [service account created in your Beamlit workspace](../../Security/Service-accounts), for which you have retrieved the `client ID` and `client secret`

## Install the controller with Helm

### Configure custom values (optional)

The Helm chart comes with [default configurations](https://github.com/beamlit/beamlit-controller/blob/main/chart/values.yaml), but you can customize them as needed.

1. **Fetch default `values.yaml`**:
    
    ```bash
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beamlit/beamlit-controller/refs/heads/main/chart/values.yaml
    ```
    
2. **Edit `values.yaml`**:
    
    Open `values.yaml` in your preferred text editor and modify the parameters as needed. 
    
    <Warning>`beamlitApiToken` is a required parameter that is the **base64 encoding** of the concatenation of `clientId` and `clientSecret` with a colon in between, like so: `clientId:clientSecret`</Warning>
    
    *Example:*
    
    ```yaml
    allowedNamespaces:
      - default
    config:
      namespaces: default
    	defaultRemoteBackend:
    		authConfig:
          # -- client-id
          clientId: "REPLACE_ME"
          # -- client-secret
          clientSecret: "REPLACE_ME"
    beamlitApiToken: "REPLACE_ME"
    ```
    

### Install the controller

Once you have configured your settings, proceed to install the controller. It is recommended to create a new namespace for this.

1. **Basic installation (with default `values.yaml`**)
    
    ```bash
    helm install beamlit-controller oci://ghcr.io/beamlit/beamlit-controller-chart
    ```
    
2. **Installation with custom `values.yaml`**:
    
    If you've customized the `values.yaml`, use the `-f` flag to apply your configurations.
    
    ```bash
    helm install beamlit-controller oci://ghcr.io/beamlit/beamlit-controller-chart -f values.yaml
    ```
    
3. **Verify installation**:
    
    ```bash
    helm list
    ```
    

### Verify the installation

Ensure that all components of the controller are running correctly.

1. **Check pods**:
    
    ```bash
    kubectl get pods
    ```
    
    You should see pods related to the Beamlit **controller** and **gateway** in the `Running` state.
    

1. **Check logs**:
    
    To troubleshoot or verify operations, view the logs of the controller pod.
    
    ```bash
    kubectl logs -l app.kubernetes.io/name=beamlit
    ```
    

### Upgrading the controller

To upgrade the controller to a newer version, follow these steps:

1. **Upgrade the release.** You can refer to this [Helm documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/registries/#other-subcommands) on subcommands:
    
    ```bash
    helm upgrade beamlit-controller oci://ghcr.io/beamlit/beamlit-controller-chart
    ```
    
    If you have a custom `values.yaml`, include the `-f` flag:
    
    ```bash
    helm upgrade beamlit-controller oci://ghcr.io/beamlit/beamlit-controller-chart -f values.yaml
    ```
    

1. **Verify the upgrade**:
    
    Check the status of the release to ensure the upgrade was successful.
    
    ```bash
    helm status beamlit-controller
    ```
    

### Uninstalling the controller

If you need to remove the controller from your cluster, run this command:

```bash
helm uninstall beamlit-controller
```

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **Helm Not Found Error**: Ensure Helm is installed and added to your system's PATH.
- **Permission Denied**: Verify that your Kubernetes context has the necessary permissions to install resources in the target namespace.
- **Pod CrashLoopBackOff**: Check the pod logs for errors and ensure that all required configurations (e.g., API keys) are correctly set in `values.yaml`.
- **Network Issues**: Ensure that your cluster can reach the control plane endpoint specified in the configuration.

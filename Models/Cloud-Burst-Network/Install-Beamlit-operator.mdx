## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following:

1. **Kubernetes Cluster**: A running Kubernetes cluster (version 1.18 or later is recommended). You can use managed services like [Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/), [Google GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine), [Azure AKS](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/kubernetes-service/), or set up your own cluster.
2. **kubectl**: Installed and configured to interact with your Kubernetes cluster. [Installation Guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/).
3. **Helm**: Installed on your local machine. [Installation Guide](Install-Beamlit-operator.md).
4. **Access Permissions**: Sufficient permissions to install resources in the target Kubernetes cluster.

## Install Helm

If you haven't installed Helm yet, follow these steps:

1. **Download Helm**:
    
    Visit the [Helm Releases](https://github.com/helm/helm/releases) page and download the appropriate binary for your operating system.
    
2. **Install Helm**:
    
    For macOS using Homebrew:
    
    ```bash
    brew install helm
    
    ```
    
    For Linux:
    
    ```bash
    curl <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3> | bash
    
    ```
    
    For Windows using Chocolatey:
    
    ```powershell
    choco install kubernetes-helm
    
    ```
    
3. **Verify Installation**:
    
    ```bash
    helm version
    
    ```
    
    You should see output similar to:
    
    ```
    version.BuildInfo{Version:"v3.10.0", GitCommit:"...", GitTreeState:"clean", GoVersion:"go1.20.5"}
    
    ```

The overflow metric is a customizable infrastructure metric that triggers [model overflow](../Model-overflow.md) when it hits a certain threshold.

Currently, Beamlit only supports metrics from a self-managed [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/), evaluated through a [Prometheus query (PromQL)](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/).

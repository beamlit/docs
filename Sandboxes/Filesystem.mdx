description: 'A simple file system interface for managing files in sandboxes.'

---

Manage files and directories within sandboxes through the `fs` module of the Blaxel SDK. This module provides essential operations for creating, reading, writing, copying, and deleting files and directories.

## Basic file system operations

### Create directory

Create a new directory at a specific path in the sandbox:

```tsx
import { SandboxInstance } from "@blaxel/sdk";

const sandbox = await SandboxInstance.get("my-sandbox")

await sandbox.fs.mkdir(`/Users/user/Downloads/test`)
```

### List files

List files in a specific path:

```tsx
const dir = await sandbox.fs.ls(`/Users/user/Downloads`);

if (dir.files?.length && dir.files?.length < 1) {
  throw new Error("Directory is empty");
}
```

### Read file

Read a file from a specific filepath:

```tsx
const content = await sandbox.fs.read(`/Users/user/Downloads/test.txt`)
```

### Write file

Create a file in a specific path:

```tsx
await sandbox.fs.write(`/Users/user/Downloads/test.txt`, "Hello world");
```

### Copy file

Copy a file from a path to another path:

```tsx
await sandbox.fs.cp(`/Users/user1/Downloads/test.txt`, `/Users/user2/Downloads`);
```

### Delete file or directory

Delete a file or directory by specifying its path:

```tsx
await sandbox.fs.rm(`/Users/user/Downloads/test.txt`);
```

title: 'Preview code in real-time'

description: 'Render an application in real-time via a direct preview URL for its running sandbox.'

---

Sometimes you may need to access a running sandbox application and preview the content in real time in a front-end client. This is useful for example to instantly preview React code generated by a codegen AI agent. 

You can do this via a **preview URL** that routes to a specific port on your sandbox (e.g. *port 3000* for `npm run dev`). This preview URL **does not require you to be authenticated** to access it. 

## Current limitations of real-time previews

JavaScript module bundlers handle real-time previewing. Here are the key compatibility requirements and limitations:

- Module bundler **must implement** [ping-pong](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455#section-5.5.2)
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) has been tested and works
- [Turbopack](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/turbopack) currently doesn't work as it doesn't support ping-pong (see [issue raised to Vercel](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/78947))
- Blaxel has a **15-minute connection timeout**. To maintain previews beyond this limit, ensure your bundler implements automatic reconnection

## Public and private preview URLs

Preview URLs can be created in either one of two modes:

- **public**: anyone can access the URL
- **private**: a key is required to access the URL (this feature is coming soon!)

## Manage preview URLs

### Blaxel console

You can create a preview URL for a sandbox from the Blaxel Console, on the overview of a sandbox:

### Blaxel SDK

Create and manage a sandbox’s preview URL: 

```tsx
	import { SandboxInstance } from "@blaxel/sdk";

	const sandbox = await SandboxInstance.get("my-sandbox")

  try {
    await sandbox.previews.create({
      metadata: {
        name: "preview-test-1"
      },
      spec: {
        port: 443,
        public: true
      }
    })
    const previews = await sandbox.previews.list()
    if (previews.length < 1) {
      throw new Error("No previews found");
    }
    const preview = await sandbox.previews.get("preview-test-1")
    if (preview.name !== "preview-test-1") {
      throw new Error("Preview name is not correct");
    }
    const url = preview.spec?.url
    if (!url) {
      throw new Error("Preview URL is not correct");
    }
    const response = await fetch(`${url}/health`)
    if (response.status !== 200) {
      throw new Error("Preview is not working");
    }
    console.log("Preview is healthy :)")
  } catch (e) {
    console.log("ERROR IN PREVIEWS NOT EXPECTED => ", e.error);
  } finally {
    await sandbox.previews.delete("preview-test-1")
  }
```

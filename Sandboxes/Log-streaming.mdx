Log streaming provides developers with real-time visibility into process outputs within sandbox environments.

<Warning>The SDK for log streaming is currently only available in TypeScript. A Python SDK is coming soon!</Warning>

## Retrieve logs

### Batch

This allows you to retrieve logs for a specific process after it has completed execution. This is useful for analyzing process output or debugging issues:

```tsx
import { SandboxInstance } from "@blaxel/sdk";

const sandbox = await SandboxInstance.get("my-sandbox")
const process = await sandbox.process.exec({name: "test", command: "echo 'Hello world'"})

const logs = await sandbox.process.logs("test");
```

### Streaming

Coming in the next few days!

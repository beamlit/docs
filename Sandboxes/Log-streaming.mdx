title: 'Log streaming'

description: 'Access logs generated by a sandbox in real time.'

---

Log streaming provides developers with visibility into process outputs within sandboxes.

<Tip>Complete code examples demonstrating all operations are available on Blaxel's GitHub: [in TypeScript](https://github.com/blaxel-ai/sdk-typescript/blob/main/tests/sandbox.ts) and [in Python](https://github.com/blaxel-ai/sdk-python/blob/main/integrationtest/sandbox.py).</Tip>

## Retrieve logs

<Accordion title="Set up authentication to Blaxel">

The Blaxel SDK authenticates with your workspace using credentials from these sources, in priority order:

1. when running on Blaxel, authentication is handled automatically
2. variables in your `.env` file (`BL_WORKSPACE` and `BL_API_KEY`, or see [this page](../Agents/Variables-and-secrets) for other authentication options). 
3. environment variables from your machine
4. configuration file created locally when you log in through [Blaxel CLI](../cli-reference/introduction) (or deploy on Blaxel)

When developing locally, the recommended method is to just **log in to your workspace with Blaxel CLI.** This allows you to run Blaxel SDK functions that will automatically connect to your workspace without additional setup. When you deploy on Blaxel, this connection persists automatically.

When running Blaxel SDK from a remote server that is not Blaxel-hosted, we recommend using environment variables as described in the third option above.

### Batch

This allows you to retrieve logs for a specific [process](Processes) (using either its name or process ID) after it has completed execution. This is useful for analyzing process output or debugging issues:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript TypeScript {6}

import { SandboxInstance } from "@blaxel/core";

const sandbox = await SandboxInstance.get("my-sandbox")
const process = await sandbox.process.exec({name: "test", command: "echo 'Hello world'"})

const logs = await sandbox.process.logs("test");

```

```python Python {15}

import asyncio
import logging
import os

from blaxel.client.models import Metadata, Port, Runtime, Sandbox, SandboxSpec
from blaxel.sandbox.base import ResponseError
from blaxel.sandbox.client.models import ProcessRequest
from blaxel.sandbox.sandbox import SandboxInstance

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

sandbox = await SandboxInstance.get(sandbox_name)
process = await sandbox.process.exec(ProcessRequest(name="test", command="echo 'Hello world'"))

logs = await sandbox.process.logs("test")

```

</CodeGroup>

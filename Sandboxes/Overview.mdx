Sandboxes are fast-launching virtual machines that both humans and AI agents can operate. They provide a basic REST API interface for accessing the file system and processes, along with an [MCP server](../Functions/Overview) that makes these capabilities available to agents.

They natively serve as **sandboxed environments for agents**. You can securely run untrusted code inside these VMs — particularly AI-generated code. This makes sandboxes ideal for codegen agents that need access to an operating system to run commands or code, without compromising security and for other users. Beyond code generation, they can just be used as general-purpose VMs for any kind of workload.

<Warning>The SDK for managing a sandbox’s lifecycle and to operate it is currently only available in TypeScript. The Python SDK is coming soon!</Warning>

## Create a sandbox

Create a new sandbox using the Blaxel SDK by specifying:

- the name of the sandbox to create
- the image to use
- the ports to expose

```tsx
import { SandboxInstance } from "@blaxel/sdk";

const sandbox = await SandboxInstance.create({
    metadata: {
      name: "my-sandbox"
    },
      spec: {
        runtime: {
	        memory: 2048,
          image: "blaxel/prod-base:latest",
          ports: [
            {
              target: 8080,
              protocol: "HTTP",
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    })
    
    

/// Wait for the sandbox to be deployed (for max 120 seconds, checking every 1 second)
await sandbox.wait({ maxWait: 120000, interval: 1000 })
```

While `SandboxInstance.create()` waits for the creation to be acknowledged, the function `sandbox.wait` allows to wait for the sandbox to be fully deployed and ready on Blaxel.

## Connect to a sandbox

Connect to an existing sandbox by passing the sandbox name:

```tsx
const sandbox = await SandboxInstance.get("sandbox-test")
```

## Overview of sandbox lifecycle

Blaxel sandboxes start in under 20 milliseconds, and scale back down after one second of inactivity, maintaining their previous state after scaling down.

Sandboxes have either one of the following statuses:

- **standby**: The sandbox is created but remains idle. You are not charged while a sandbox is in standby mode. Sandboxes transition from *standby* to *active* mode in approximately 20 ms.
- **active**: The sandbox is running and processing tasks. You **are** charged for active runtime. Sandboxes automatically return to standby mode after 1 second of inactivity.
- **stopped**: The sandbox is shut down and requires manual restart to access its API.

Sandboxes are fast-launching virtual machines that both humans and AI agents can operate. They provide a basic [REST API interface](https://docs.blaxel.ai/api-reference/filesystem) for accessing the file system and processes, along with an [MCP server](../Functions/Overview) that makes these capabilities available to agents.

They natively serve as **sandboxed environments for agents**. You can securely run untrusted code inside these VMs â€” particularly AI-generated code. This makes sandboxes ideal for codegen agents that need access to an operating system to run commands or code, without compromising security and for other users. Beyond code generation, they can just be used as general-purpose VMs for any kind of workload.

## Create a sandbox

Create a new sandbox using the Blaxel SDK by specifying a name, the image to use and the ports to expose. **Port 8080** is the sandbox API, it is mandatory to set it if you want to use t. 

<Info>The list of public images [can be found here](https://github.com/blaxel-ai/sandbox/tree/main/hub). To create a sandbox with one of those images, enter `blaxel/prod-{NAME}:latest` (e.g. *blaxel/prod-base:latest*).</Info>

<Accordion title="Set up authentication to Blaxel">

The Blaxel SDK authenticates with your workspace using credentials from these sources, in priority order:

1. when running on Blaxel, authentication is handled automatically
2. variables in your `.env` file (`BL_WORKSPACE` and `BL_API_KEY`, or see [this page](../Agents/Variables-and-secrets) for other authentication options). 
3. environment variables from your machine
4. configuration file created locally when you log in through [Blaxel CLI](../cli-reference/introduction) (or deploy on Blaxel)

When developing locally, the recommended method is to just **log in to your workspace with Blaxel CLI.** This allows you to run Blaxel SDK functions that will automatically connect to your workspace without additional setup. When you deploy on Blaxel, this connection persists automatically.

When running Blaxel SDK from a remote server that is not Blaxel-hosted, we recommend using environment variables as described in the third option above.

```typescript TypeScript

import { SandboxInstance } from "@blaxel/core";

/// Start sandbox creation
const sandbox = await SandboxInstance.create({
    metadata: {
        name: "my-sandbox"
    },
    spec: {
        runtime: {
            memory: 2048,
            image: "blaxel/prod-base:latest",
            ports: [
                {
                    target: 8080,
                    protocol: "HTTP",
                }
            ]
        }
    }
})

/// Wait for the sandbox to be deployed (for max 120 seconds, checking every 1 second)
await sandbox.wait({ maxWait: 120000, interval: 1000 })

```

```python Python

import asyncio
import logging
import os

from blaxel.client.models import Metadata, Port, Runtime, Sandbox, SandboxSpec
from blaxel.sandbox.base import ResponseError
from blaxel.sandbox.client.models import ProcessRequest
from blaxel.sandbox.sandbox import SandboxInstance

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

async def create_sandbox(sandbox_name: str):
    image = "blaxel/prod-base:latest"
    ### Start sandbox creation
    sandbox = await SandboxInstance.create(Sandbox(
        metadata=Metadata(name=sandbox_name),
        spec=SandboxSpec(
            runtime=Runtime(
                image=image,
                memory=2048,
                ports=[
                    Port(name="sandbox-api", target=8080, protocol="HTTP")
                ]
            )
        )
    ))

    ### Wait for the sandbox to be deployed (for max 120 seconds, checking every 1 second)
    await sandbox.wait(max_wait=120000, interval=1000)
    logger.info("Sandbox deployed")
    return sandbox

```

</CodeGroup>

While `SandboxInstance.create()` waits for the creation to be acknowledged, the function `sandbox.wait` allows to wait for the sandbox to be fully deployed and ready on Blaxel. 

### Images

Custom images are currently not supported. [Contact us](https://blaxel.ai/contact?purpose=custom_sandboxes&origin=docs) to host your own image.

## Retrieve an existing sandbox

To reconnect to an existing sandbox, simply provide its name:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript TypeScript

const sandbox = await SandboxInstance.get("my-sandbox")

```

```python Python

sandbox = await SandboxInstance.get("my-sandbox")

```

</CodeGroup>

### Create if not exists

This helper function either retrieves an existing sandbox or creates a new one if it doesn't exist. Blaxel first checks for an existing sandbox with the provided `name` and either retrieves it or creates a new one using your specified configuration.

<CodeGroup>

```typescript TypeScript

const sandbox = await SandboxInstance.createIfNotExists({
    metadata: {
        name: "my-sandbox"
    },
    spec: {
        runtime: {
            memory: 2048,
            image: "blaxel/prod-base:latest",
            ports: [
                {
                    target: 8080,
                    protocol: "HTTP",
                }
            ]
        }
    }
})

```

## Overview of sandbox lifecycle

Blaxel sandboxes start from `standby` to `active` in **under 20 milliseconds**, and scale back down top `standby` **after one second of inactivity**, maintaining their previous state after scaling down.

Here is the summary on the possible statuses for a sandbox:

- **`standby`**: The sandbox is created but is hibernating. You are not charged while a sandbox is in standby mode. Sandboxes transition from *standby* to *active* mode in approximately 20 ms.
- **`active`**: The sandbox is running and processing tasks. You **are** charged for active runtime. Sandboxes automatically return to standby mode after 1 second of inactivity.
- **`stopped`**: The sandbox is shut down and **requires manual restart** to access its API.

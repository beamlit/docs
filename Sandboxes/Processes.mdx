Execute and manage processes in your sandboxes with Blaxel SDK. Run shell commands, retrieve process information, and control process execution.

<Tip>Complete code examples demonstrating all operations are available on Blaxel's GitHub: [in TypeScript](https://github.com/beamlit/sdk-typescript/blob/main/integrationtest/sandbox.ts) and [in Python](https://github.com/beamlit/sdk-python/blob/main/integrationtest/sandbox.py).</Tip>

## Execute processes and commands

### Execute command

Execute shell commands using the TypeScript SDK:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript TypeScript {5}

import { SandboxInstance } from "@blaxel/sdk";

const sandbox = await SandboxInstance.get("my-sandbox")

const process = await sandbox.process.exec({command: "echo 'Hello world'"})

if (process.status === "completed") {
  throw new Error("Process did complete without waiting");
}

```

```python Python {12}

import asyncio
import logging
import os

from blaxel.client.models import Metadata, Port, Runtime, Sandbox, SandboxSpec
from blaxel.sandbox.base import ResponseError
from blaxel.sandbox.client.models import ProcessRequest
from blaxel.sandbox.sandbox import SandboxInstance

sandbox = await SandboxInstance.get("my-sandbox")

process = await sandbox.process.exec(ProcessRequest(command="echo 'Hello world'"))
assert getattr(process, "status", None) != "completed", "Process did complete without waiting"

```

</CodeGroup>

### Use process names

When starting a process (running a command), you can specify a **process name**. This lets you interact with the process—such as retrieving logs or process information—without needing to store the process ID on your end.

<CodeGroup>

```typescript TypeScript

const process = await sandbox.process.exec({
  name: "test",
  command: "echo 'Hello world'",
})

```

```python Python

process = await sandbox.process.exec(ProcessRequest(name="test", command="echo 'Hello world'"))

```

</CodeGroup>

You can use either the process name or the process ID to get information about the process:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript TypeScript {3}

await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 10));

const completedProcess = await sandbox.process.get("test");

if (completedProcess.status !== "completed") {
  throw new Error("Process did not complete");

```

```python Python {3}

await asyncio.sleep(0.01)

completed_process = await sandbox.process.get("test")

assert getattr(completed_process, "status", None) == "completed", "Process did not complete"

```

</CodeGroup>

You can also use the process ID or name to [retrieve logs of your processes](Log-streaming).

### Process statuses

A process can have either of the following status:

- `running`
- `completed`
- `failed`

### Kill process

Kill a process immediately by running:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript TypeScript

await sandbox.process.kill("test")

```

```python Python

await sandbox.process.kill("test")

```

</CodeGroup>

## Call a sandbox on a specific port

You can call your sandbox on a specific port by using a URL that follows this format. This is useful when you need to expose specific services or applications running in your sandbox:

```
https://run.blaxel.ai/{workspace_id}/sandboxes/{sandbox_id}/port/{port_number}
```

Execute and manage processes in your sandboxes with Blaxel SDK. Run shell commands, work with process names, retrieve process information, and control process execution.

<Warning>The SDK for managing processes is currently only available in TypeScript. A Python SDK is coming soon!</Warning>

## Execute processes and commands

### Execute command

Execute shell commands using the TypeScript SDK:

```tsx
import { SandboxInstance } from "@blaxel/sdk";

const sandbox = await SandboxInstance.get("my-sandbox")

const process = await sandbox.process.exec({command: "echo 'Hello world'"})

if (process.status === "completed") {
  throw new Error("Process did complete without waiting");
}
```

### Use process names

When starting a process (running a command), you can specify a **process name**. This lets you interact with the process—such as retrieving logs or process information—without needing to store the process ID on your end.

```tsx
const process = await sandbox.process.exec({
  name: "test",
  command: "echo 'Hello world'",
})
```

You can use either the process name or the process ID to get information about the process:

```tsx
await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 10));

const completedProcess = await sandbox.process.get("test");

if (completedProcess.status !== "completed") {
  throw new Error("Process did not complete");
```

You can also use the process ID or name to [retrieve logs of your processes](Log-streaming).

### Kill process

Kill a process immediately by running:

```tsx
await sandbox.process.kill("test")
```

## Call a sandbox on a specific port

You can call your sandbox on a specific port by using a URL that follows this format. This is useful when you need to expose specific services or applications running in your sandbox.

```bash
https://run.blaxel.ai/{workspace_id}/sandboxes/{sandbox_id}/port/{port_number}
```

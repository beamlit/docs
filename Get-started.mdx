Beamlit is a serverless platform that enables AI teams to **push and run any AI agent in a production-critical environment** in a single click. This tutorial demonstrates how to deploy your first AI agent on Beamlit.

## Quickstart

Welcome there! ðŸ‘‹ Make sure you have created an account on Beamlit, and created a first [workspace](Security/Workspace-access-control). 

<Tip>Upon creating a workspace, Beamlit automatically adds a sandbox connection to a model API to get you started. Model APIs provide developers with a centralized interface that simplifies credential management and LLM provider access.</Tip>

<Steps>

<Step title="Install the Beamlit CLI">

<Accordion title="Install on Mac" icon="apple">

<Warning>To install the Beamlit CLI, you must use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/): make sure it is installed on your machine. We are currently in the process of supporting additional installers. Please reach out to [support@beamlit.com](mailto:support@beamlit.com) if you need to use an alternative to Homebrew.</Warning>

Install the Beamlit CLI by running the two following commands successively in a terminal:

```shell 

### Tap the Beamlit formula to Homebrew

brew tap beamlit/beamlit

```

```shell 

### Install the Beamlit CLI using Homebrew
brew install beamlit

```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Install on Linux" icon="linux">

Install the Beamlit CLI by running the following command in a terminal (alternatives below):

```shell 
curl -fsSL \
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beamlit/toolkit/main/install.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beamlit/toolkit/main/install.sh) \
| BINDIR=$HOME/.local/bin sh
```

If you need to use `sudo`, or specify a version, run one of the following commands instead:

```shell 
### With version
curl -fsSL \
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beamlit/toolkit/main/install.sh \
| VERSION=0.36.0 BINDIR=$HOME/.local/bin sh

### With Sudo:
curl -fsSL \
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beamlit/toolkit/main/install.sh \
| BINDIR=/usr/local/bin sudo -E sh
```

<Accordion title="Login to Beamlit via the CLI.">
Run the following command in a terminal to login to Beamlit. 

```bash
bl login your-workspace-slug
```

</Accordion>

</Step>

<Step title="Create your first AI agent">

Letâ€™s initialize a first app. The following command creates a **pre-scaffolded local repository** ready for developing and deploying your agent on Beamlit. You will need to [have *uv* installed](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for this.

```bash
bl create-agent-app my-agent
```

You can now [use the Beamlit SDK to develop](Agents/Develop-an-agent) your agent's core logic in `/my-agent/src/agent.py` and define your functions in `/my-agent/src/functions` â€” functions in this folder are automatically bound to the main agent. 

</Step>

<Step title="Test and deploy your AI agent">

Run the following command to serve your agent locally:

```bash
cd my-agent;
bl serve --hotreload;
```

Query your agent locally by making a **POST** request to this endpoint: [`http://localhost:1338`](http://localhost:1338) with the following payload format: `{"inputs": "Hello world!"}`.

To push to Beamlit on the default *production* environment, run the following command. Beamlit will handle the build and deployment:

```bash
bl deploy
```

Your agent is available behind a **global endpoint**  ðŸŒŽÂ . Read [this guide](Agents/Query-agents) on how to use it for HTTP requests.

</Step>

<Step title="Make a first inference">

Run a first inference on your Beamlit agent with the following command:

```bash
bl run agent my-agent --data '{"inputs":"Hello world!"}'
```

</Step>

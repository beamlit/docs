Beamlit is a serverless cloud platform that enables AI teams to **push and run any AI workload across multiple locations** in a single click. This tutorial demonstrates how to deploy your first AI model on Beamlit.

<Info>Beamlit also lets you replicate a model deployment from your private Kubernetes cluster. To get started with this method, read [this tutorial](Examples/Offload-burst-inferences-from-a-self-hosted-model.mdx).</Info>

### Install the Beamlit CLI

You can install the [Beamlit CLI](cli-reference.mdx) using the by running the following 2 commands successively in a terminal:

```bash
### Tap the Beamlit formula to Homebrew
brew tap beamlit/beamlit

### Install the Beamlit CLI using Homebrew
brew install beamlit
```

### Deploy a model

Make sure you have created an account on Beamlit, and created a first [workspace](Security/Workspace-access-control.mdx). Then, run the following command in a terminal to login to Beamlit. Use the **Device** mode to authenticate via your browser.

```bash
beamlit login your-workspace-slugified-name
```

Let’s deploy **a simple model from HuggingFace** (a simple *sentence-transformers* model). Run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
cat << 'EOF' | beamlit apply -f -
apiVersion: beamlit.com/v1alpha1
kind: Model
metadata:
  name: my-model
spec:
  deployments:
  - environment: production
    runtime:
      model: sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2
      type: huggingface
EOF
```

That’s it! 🌎 🌏 🌍 Your model is now **distributed and available** across the entire Beamlit global infrastructure! [Global Inference Network](Models/Global-Inference-Network.mdx) significantly speeds up inferences by positioning workloads near your users and smartly routing requests based on your policies.

### Make a first inference

Run a first inference on your model with the following command:

```bash
beamlit run my-model --data '{"inputs":"What is the encoding for this input?"}'
```

<Tip>Your model is available behind a **global endpoint**. Read [this guide](Models/Query-a-model.mdx) on how to use it for HTTP requests.</Tip>

description: 'Make invocation requests on your functions.'

Function [deployments](../Functions%2015347e47b1ea80eda0e5d4354f5ba238) on Beamlit have an **invocation endpoint** which can be used by external consumers to request an invocation execution. Invocation requests are then routed on the [Global invocation Network](../Models/Global-Inference-Network%2013847e47b1ea8199a2b3fa9c62f9e09e) based on the [deployment policies](../Models/Model-deployment) associated with your function deployment. 

## Invocation endpoints

Whenever you deploy a function on Beamlit, an **invocation endpoint** is generated on Global invocation Network.

The invocation URL looks like this:

```

run.beamlit.com/{your-workspace}/functions/{your-function}

```

There is one distinct endpoint for each **function deployment,** i.e. for each combination of a [function](../Models/Model-deployment%2013847e47b1ea8103a274c27cff3de584) and an [environment](../Model-Governance/Environments) on which it is deployed. 

For example, if you have one version of function “your-function” deployed on the *production* environment and one version deployed on the *development* environment:

- `run.beamlit.com/{your-workspace}/functions/{your-function}?environment=production` will call the production deployment
- `run.beamlit.com/{your-workspace}/functions/{your-function}?environment=development` will call the development deployment

If you do not specify the environment in the invocation request, it will call the *production* environment by default. If the function is not deployed on the production environment, it will return an error.

### Endpoint authentication

By default, functions deployed on Beamlit aren’t public. It is necessary to authenticate all invocation requests, via a [bearer token](../Security/Access-tokens).

The evaluation of authentication/authorization for invocation requests is managed by the Global invocation Network based on the [access given in your workspace](../Security/Workspace-access-control).

<Info>Making a function publicly available is not yet available. Please contact us at [support@beamlit.com](mailto:support@beamlit.com) if this is something that you need today.</Info>

## Make an invocation request

### Beamlit API

Make a **POST** request to the invocation endpoint for the function deployment you are requesting, making sure to fill in the authentication token:

```
curl 'https://run.beamlit.com/YOUR-WORKSPACE/functions/YOUR-function?environment=YOUR-ENVIRONMENT' \
  -H 'accept: application/json, text/plain, */*' \
  -H 'x-beamlit-authorization: Bearer YOUR-TOKEN' \
  -H 'x-beamlit-workspace: YOUR-WORKSPACE' \
  --data-raw $'{"inputs":"Enter your input here."}'
```

Read about [the API parameters in the reference](https://docs.beamlit.com/api-reference/inference).

### Beamlit CLI

The following command will make a default POST request to the function’s *production* deployment (by default), on the base endpoint.

```bash
bl run function your-function --data '{"inputs":"Enter your input here."}'
```

Read about [the CLI parameters in the reference](https://docs.beamlit.com/cli-reference/beamlit_run).

### Beamlit console

invocation requests can be made from the Beamlit console from the function deployment’s workbench page.

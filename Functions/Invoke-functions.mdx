title: 'Invoke a function (i.e. MCP server)'

description: 'Make invocation requests on your functions and MCP servers.'

---

Function [deployments](Overview%2015347e47b1ea8038813fef14c49dfd5e) on Blaxel have an **invocation endpoint** which can be used by external consumers to request an invocation execution. Invocation requests are then routed on the [Global Inference Network](../Models/Global-Inference-Network%2013847e47b1ea8199a2b3fa9c62f9e09e) based on the [deployment policies](../Model-Governance/Policies) associated with your function deployment. 

When an [agent](../Agents/Overview) requests a function execution, it uses the same invocation endpoint routed through the Global Inference Network.

## Invocation endpoints

When you deploy a function on Blaxel, an invocation endpoint is generated on Global Inference Network. The **protocol used for communication depends on the type of function**: pre-built functions use WebSockets, while custom functions use HTTPS.

The invocation endpoint looks like this:

```markdown Query function

run.blaxel.ai/{YOUR-WORKSPACE}/functions/{YOUR-FUNCTION}

```

### Endpoint authentication

By default, functions deployed on Blaxel aren’t public. It is necessary to authenticate all invocation requests, via a [bearer token](../Security/Access-tokens).

The evaluation of authentication/authorization for invocation requests is managed by the Global Inference Network based on the [access given in your workspace](../Security/Workspace-access-control).

<Info>Making a function publicly available is not yet available. Please contact us at [support@blaxel.ai](mailto:support@blaxel.ai) if this is something that you need today.</Info>

## Make an invocation request

### Blaxel API

Using this endpoint to make invocation requests is done differently depending whether the function is one of your **custom functions** or if it is a **pre-built Blaxel function.**

**Custom functions** can be invoked by calling the root endpoint using the **HTTPS protocol**. Make a *POST* request to the invocation endpoint for the function deployment you are requesting, making sure to fill in the authentication token:

```bash
curl 'https://run.blaxel.ai/YOUR-WORKSPACE/functions/YOUR-function' \
  -H 'accept: application/json, text/plain, */*' \
  -H 'X-Blaxel-Authorization: Bearer YOUR-TOKEN' \
  -H 'X-Blaxel-Workspace: YOUR-WORKSPACE' \
  --data-raw $'{"inputs":"Enter your input here."}'
```

<Info>Read about [the API parameters in the reference](https://docs.blaxel.ai/api-reference/inference).</Info>

**Pre-built functions** are [Model Context Protocol](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol) (MCP) servers deployed on Blaxel. They provide a toolkit of multiple tools—individual capabilities for accessing specific APIs or databases. These functions can be interacted using WebSocket protocol. 

They offer two methods:

- `tools/list` A method that **lists the available tools** and their schemas, allowing consumers (you or agents) to discover the function’s capabilities.
- `tools/call` A method that lets consumers **execute individual tools**. It requires params with two keys:
    - `name`: the name of the tool to run, obtained from the listing endpoint above
    - `arguments`: an object with the key and values of input parameters for the execution, obtained from the listing endpoint above

Example of `tools/list` outbound message on a Brave Search toolkit (make sure to fill in the authentication token).

```json
{
	"method":"tools/list",
	"jsonrpc":"2.0",
	"id":1
}
```

This one returns two tools in the function: ***brave_web_search*** and ***brave_local_search***.

```json
{
    "result": {
        "tools": [
            {
                "name": "blaxel_web_search",

                    "type": "object",
                    "properties": {

                    "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"
                }
            },
            {
                "name": "blaxel_local_search",
                "description": "Searches for local businesses and places using Brave's Local Search API. Best for queries related to physical locations, businesses, restaurants, services, etc. Returns detailed information including:\n- Business names and addresses\n- Ratings and review counts\n- Phone numbers and opening hours\nUse this when the query implies 'near me' or mentions specific locations.

            }
        ]
    },
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": "1"
}
```

Example of `tools/call` outbound message on the ***brave_web_search*** tool.

```json
{
	"jsonrpc":"2.0",
	"id":2,
	"method":"tools/call",
	"params":{
		"name":"blaxel_web_search",
		"arguments":{
			"query":"What is the current weather in NYC?",
			"count":1,
			"offset":1
			}
		}
}
```

### Blaxel CLI

The following command is **only compatible with custom functions** and will make a default POST request to the function’s deployment (by default), on the base endpoint.

```bash
bl run function your-function --data '{"inputs":"Enter your input here."}'
```

<Info>Read about [the CLI parameters in the reference](https://docs.blaxel.ai/cli-reference/bl_run).</Info>

At the moment, pre-built Blaxel functions cannot be invoked via Blaxel CLI.

### Blaxel console

invocation requests can be made from the Blaxel console from the function deployment’s **Playground** page.

title: 'Invoke a function (i.e. MCP server)'

description: 'Make invocation requests on your functions and MCP servers.'

---

Blaxel has a **purpose-built implementation for MCP transport** **that uses WebSockets** protocol instead of Server-Sent Events (SSE) or stdio to feature robust capabilities — including persistent connections with automatic reconnection handling, multi-tenant support, health monitoring, and seamless AI framework integration.

At this time, MCP servers deployed on Blaxel are only hosted server-side and cannot be installed locally. Only WebSockets protocol is supported.

## MCP server endpoint

When you deploy an MCP server on Blaxel, a WebSocket-based endpoint is generated on Global Agentics Network to connect to the server.

The server endpoint looks like this:

```http Connect to an MCP server

wss://run.blaxel.ai/{YOUR-WORKSPACE}/functions/{YOUR-SERVER-NAME}

```

### Endpoint authentication

By default, MCP servers deployed on Blaxel aren’t public. It is necessary to authenticate all connections, via a [bearer token](../Security/Access-tokens).

The evaluation of authentication/authorization for messages is managed by the Global Agentics Network based on the [access given in your workspace](../Security/Workspace-access-control).

<Info>Making a function publicly available is not yet available. Please contact us at [support@blaxel.ai](mailto:support@blaxel.ai) if this is something that you need today.</Info>

## Make an invocation request

### Using the API

**MCP servers** ([Model Context Protocol](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol)) provide a toolkit of multiple tools—individual capabilities for accessing specific APIs or databases. These servers can be interacted with using WebSocket protocol on the server’s global endpoint. 

Blaxel’s pre-built MCP servers offer two methods:

- `tools/list` A method that **lists the available tools** and their schemas, allowing consumers (you or agents) to discover the function’s capabilities.
- `tools/call` A method that lets consumers **execute individual tools**. It requires params with two keys:
    - `name`: the name of the tool to run, obtained from the listing endpoint above
    - `arguments`: an object with the key and values of input parameters for the execution, obtained from the listing endpoint above

Example of `tools/list` outbound message on a Brave Search toolkit (make sure to fill in the authentication token).

```json
{
	"method":"tools/list",
	"jsonrpc":"2.0",
	"id":1
}
```

This one returns two tools in the function: ***brave_web_search*** and ***brave_local_search***.

```json
{
    "result": {
        "tools": [
            {
                "name": "blaxel_web_search",
                "description": "Performs a web search using the Brave Search API, ideal for general queries, news, articles, and online content. Use this for broad information gathering, recent events, or when you need diverse web sources. Supports pagination, content filtering, and freshness controls. Maximum 20 results per request, with offset for pagination. ",
                "inputSchema": {
                    "type": "object",
                    "properties": {
                        "query": {
                            "type": "string"
                        },

                    "additionalProperties": false,
                    "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"
                }
            },
            {
                "name": "blaxel_local_search",
                "description": "Searches for local businesses and places using Brave's Local Search API. Best for queries related to physical locations, businesses, restaurants, services, etc. Returns detailed information including:\n- Business names and addresses\n- Ratings and review counts\n- Phone numbers and opening hours\nUse this when the query implies 'near me' or mentions specific locations. Automatically falls back to web search if no local results are found.",
                "inputSchema": {
                    "type": "object",
                    "properties": {
                        "query": {
                            "type": "string"
                        },
                        "count": {
                            "type": "number"
                        }
                    },
                    "additionalProperties": false,
                    "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"
                }
            }
        ]
    },
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": "1"
}
```

Example of `tools/call` outbound message on the ***brave_web_search*** tool.

```json
{
	"jsonrpc":"2.0",
	"id":2,
	"method":"tools/call",
	"params":{
		"name":"blaxel_web_search",
		"arguments":{
			"query":"What is the current weather in NYC?",
			"count":1,
			"offset":1
			}
		}
}
```

### Blaxel console

Requests to an MCP server can be made from the Blaxel console from the server deployment’s **Playground** page.

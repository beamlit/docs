title: 'Invoke a function'

description: 'Make invocation requests on your functions.'

---

Function [deployments](Overview%2015347e47b1ea8038813fef14c49dfd5e) on Beamlit have an **invocation endpoint** which can be used by external consumers to request an invocation execution. Invocation requests are then routed on the [Global Inference Network](../Models/Global-Inference-Network%2013847e47b1ea8199a2b3fa9c62f9e09e) based on the [deployment policies](../Model-Governance/Policies) associated with your function deployment. 

When an [agent](../Agents/Overview) requests a function execution, it uses the same invocation endpoint routed through the Global Inference Network.

## Invocation endpoints

Whenever you deploy a function on Beamlit, an **invocation endpoint** is generated on Global Inference Network.

The invocation URL looks like this:

```http Query function

POST run.beamlit.com/{your-workspace}/functions/{your-function}

```

There is one distinct endpoint for each **function deployment,** i.e. for each combination of a [function](Overview%2015347e47b1ea8038813fef14c49dfd5e) and an [environment](../Model-Governance/Environments) on which it is deployed. 

For example, if you have one version of function “your-function” deployed on the *production* environment and one version deployed on the *development* environment:

- `run.beamlit.com/{your-workspace}/functions/{your-function}?environment=production` will call the production deployment
- `run.beamlit.com/{your-workspace}/functions/{your-function}?environment=development` will call the development deployment

If you do not specify the environment in the invocation request, it will call the *production* environment by default. If the function is not deployed on the production environment, it will return an error.

### Endpoint authentication

By default, functions deployed on Beamlit aren’t public. It is necessary to authenticate all invocation requests, via a [bearer token](../Security/Access-tokens).

The evaluation of authentication/authorization for invocation requests is managed by the Global Inference Network based on the [access given in your workspace](../Security/Workspace-access-control).

<Info>Making a function publicly available is not yet available. Please contact us at [support@beamlit.com](mailto:support@beamlit.com) if this is something that you need today.</Info>

## Make an invocation request

Using this endpoint to make invocation requests is done differently depending whether the function is a **pre-built Beamlit function** or if it is your **custom function**.

### Beamlit API

**Custom functions** can be invoked by calling the root endpoint. Make a **POST** request to the invocation endpoint for the function deployment you are requesting, making sure to fill in the authentication token:

```bash
curl 'https://run.beamlit.com/YOUR-WORKSPACE/functions/YOUR-function?environment=YOUR-ENVIRONMENT' \
  -H 'accept: application/json, text/plain, */*' \
  -H 'X-Beamlit-Authorization: Bearer YOUR-TOKEN' \
  -H 'X-Beamlit-Workspace: YOUR-WORKSPACE' \
  --data-raw $'{"inputs":"Enter your input here."}'
```

<Info>Read about [the API parameters in the reference](https://docs.beamlit.com/api-reference/inference).</Info>

**Pre-built functions** are Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers deployed on Beamlit. They provide a toolkit of multiple tools—individual capabilities for accessing specific APIs or databases. These functions offer two endpoints:

- `/tools/list` An endpoint that **lists the available tools** and their schemas, allowing consumers (you or agents) to discover the function’s capabilities.
- `/tools/call` A POST endpoint that lets consumers **execute individual tools**. It requires a payload with two keys:
    - `name`: the name of the tool to run, obtained from the listing endpoint above
    - `arguments`: an object with the key and values of input parameters for the execution, obtained from the listing endpoint above

Example of `/tools/list` GET request on a Brave Search toolkit (make sure to fill in the authentication token).

```bash
curl -X GET "https://run.beamlit.com/YOUR-WORKSPACE/functions/web-search/tools/list" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "X-Beamlit-Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>"
```

This one returns two tools in the function: ***brave_web_search*** and ***brave_local_search***.

```json
// Returns the following payload

{
  "tools": [
    {
      "name": "brave_web_search",
      "description": "Performs a web search using the Brave Search API, ideal for general queries, news, articles, and online content. Use this for broad information gathering, recent events, or when you need diverse web sources. Supports pagination, content filtering, and freshness controls. Maximum 20 results per request, with offset for pagination. ",
      "inputSchema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "query": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Search query (max 400 chars, 50 words)"
          },
          "count": {
            "type": "number",
            "description": "Number of results (1-20, default 10)",
            "default": 10
          },
          "offset": {
            "type": "number",
            "description": "Pagination offset (max 9, default 0)",
            "default": 0
          }
        },
        "required": [
          "query"
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "brave_local_search",
      "description": "Searches for local businesses and places using Brave's Local Search API. Best for queries related to physical locations, businesses, restaurants, services, etc. Returns detailed information including:\n- Business names and addresses\n- Ratings and review counts\n- Phone numbers and opening hours\nUse this when the query implies 'near me' or mentions specific locations. Automatically falls back to web search if no local results are found.",
      "inputSchema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "query": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Local search query (e.g. 'pizza near Central Park')"
          },
          "count": {
            "type": "number",
            "description": "Number of results (1-20, default 5)",
            "default": 5
          }
        },
        "required": [
          "query"
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Example of `/tools/call` POST request on the ***brave_web_search*** tool (make sure to fill in the authentication token).

```bash
curl -X POST "https://run.beamlit.com/YOUR-WORKSPACE/functions/web-search/tools/call" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "X-Beamlit-Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>" \
  -d '{"name":"brave_web_search","arguments":{"query":"current weather in San Francisco"}}'
```

### Beamlit CLI

The following command will make a default POST request to the function’s *production* deployment (by default), on the base endpoint.

```bash
bl run function your-function --data '{"inputs":"Enter your input here."}'
```

<Info>Read about [the CLI parameters in the reference](https://docs.beamlit.com/cli-reference/beamlit_run).</Info>

### Beamlit console

invocation requests can be made from the Beamlit console from the function deployment’s **Playground** page.

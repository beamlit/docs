Functions represent **custom code** that can be executed by passing specific input arguments. 

Beamlit runs your code on Global Inference Network, a high-availability and low-latency compute infrastructure. You only provide the code, and Beamlit automates its execution and scaling - providing you with one single globally endpoint to run the function. 

Functions are designed to **equip agents with tools** to interact with the world. When an agent runs on Beamlit, our Global Inference Network accelerates the whole execution behind the scenes, by running the function separately from the action model and agent logic. This ensures minimal latency for your consumers as well as optimal resource utilization. 

## Deploy a function on Beamlit

A function can be uploaded into Beamlit from a variety of origins.

- Using a function from the Beamlit Store
- From a custom code
- *From Github (coming soon!)*

### Deploy from the Beamlit store

The Beamlit store contains a curated list of functions and tools from the most popular providers that can be **deployed out-of-the-box on Beamlit**. They are lightweight programs that expose specific capabilities (accessing databases, APIs, local files, etc.) through the standardized [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) (MCP).

Depending on the function you choose, you will need to enter credentials as an [integration](../Integrations), such as an API key if your tool is using a third-party service provider.

### Deploy from custom code

You can deploy **any custom Python or TypeScript code** as a serverless function on Beamlit. 

The easiest way to deploy a function is to deploy it as part of an agent application. [Read more about developing and deploying custom agents and functions here](../Agents/Develop-an-agent). 

### Environment

Select the environment on which to deploy your workload. Environments give you a dedicated production or development endpoint for your application life-cycle. A function or model API that is deployed in an environment can only be used by agents in the same environment.

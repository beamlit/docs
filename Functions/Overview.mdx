MCP servers (called *functions* in Blaxel API) represent **custom code** that can be executed by passing specific input arguments. They are lightweight programs that expose specific capabilities (accessing databases, APIs, local files, etc.) through the standardized [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) (MCP). MCP servers are designed to **equip agents with tools** to interact with the world. When an agent runs on Blaxel, the function in the MCP server is run separately from the action model and agent logic. This ensures not only minimal latency for your consumers as well as optimal resource utilization, but also better design practice for your agentic system.

When deployed on Blaxel, MCP servers are hosted on Global Agentics Network, a high-availability and low-latency compute infrastructure. You only provide the code, and Blaxel automates its hosting, execution and scaling - providing you with one single global endpoint to access the MCP server. 

Deployed MCP servers have a runtime limit after which executions time out. This timeout duration is determined by your chosen [infrastructure generation](../Infrastructure/Gens). For Mk 2 generation, the **default timeout is 5 minutes**, but this can be increased up to 60 minutes depending on your workspace quota.

## MCP hosting on Blaxel

Blaxel has a **purpose-built implementation for MCP transport** **that uses WebSockets** protocol instead of Server-Sent Events (SSE) or stdio to feature cloud deployment capabilities.

At this time, MCP servers deployed on Blaxel are only hosted server-side and cannot be installed locally. Only WebSockets protocol is supported.

<Info>For developers interested in the technical details, our implementation is available open-source through [Blaxel's Supergateway](https://github.com/beamlit/supergateway) and [Blaxel's SDK](https://github.com/beamlit/toolkit/blob/main/sdk-ts/src/functions/mcp.ts).</Info>

There are two routes you can take when hosting MCPs on Blaxel:

- Use one of the pre-built MCP servers from the Blaxel Store
- Deploy a custom MCP server from your code

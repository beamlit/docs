title: 'Develop a custom MCP server'

description: 'Create your own custom MCP Servers.'

---

You can **develop custom [MCP servers](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) in TypeScript** and deploy them on Blaxel by integrating a few lines of the Blaxel SDK and leveraging our other developer tools ([Blaxel CLI](https://www.notion.so/cli-reference), GitHub action, etc.).

## Quickstart

<Warning>It is required to have *npm* installed to use the following command.</Warning>

You can quickly **initialize a new MCP server from scratch** by using CLI command `bl create-mcp-server`. This will create a pre-scaffolded local repo where your entire code can be added.

```
bl create-mcp-server
```

After [serving the MCP server locally](Deploy-a-function) (by running `bl serve`), you can test it by running `pnpm test`. This command will call two functions in the hello-world MCP server.

- **List tools** -> List all the tools available in the server.
- **Call tool: hello_world** -> Call the hello_world tool defined in the server.

## Develop the MCP server logic

If you open the `src/server.ts` file, you'll see the complete server implementation. It follows the MCP server standard closely, with the only difference being **our use of Blaxel transport** for efficient platform serving.

The main component you'll need to modify is the tool definition:

```typescript {12-24}

import { BlaxelMcpServerTransport, logger } from "@blaxel/sdk";
import { McpServer } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js";
import { StdioServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js";
import { z } from "zod";

const server = new McpServer({
  name: "mymcp",
  version: "1.0.0",
  description: ""
});

server.tool(
  "hello_world",
  "Say hello to a person",
  {
    firstname: z.string()
  },
  async ({firstname}) => {
    logger.info(`Hello world called`);
    return {
      content: [{ type: "text", text: `Hello ${firstname}` }]
    }
  }
);

function main() {
  let transport;
  if (process.env.BL_SERVER_PORT) {
    transport = new BlaxelMcpServerTransport();
  } else {
    transport = new StdioServerTransport();
  }
  server.connect(transport);
  logger.info("Server started");
}

main();

```

Remember that the `name`, `description`, and *parameters* are crucialâ€”they help your agent understand how your tool functions.

## Deploy your MCP server

Just run `bl deploy` in the folder of your project, as explained [in this guide](Deploy-a-function).

```
bl deploy
```

## Test the server locally

While developing the MCP server, you can easily launch test commands. Open the `src/client.ts` file to see how it works and replace/add any test calls you want to verify there:

```typescript {25-29}

import { BlaxelMcpClientTransport, logger } from "@blaxel/sdk";
import { Client } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/index.js";

const transport = new BlaxelMcpClientTransport(
  '<http://localhost:1338>'
);

const client = new Client(
  {
    name: "mcp-client",
    version: "1.0.0"
  },
  {
    capabilities: {
      tools: {}
    }
  }
);

async function main() {
  await client.connect(transport);
  const {tools} = await client.listTools();
  logger.info(JSON.stringify(tools));

  const result = await client.callTool({
    name:"hello_world",
    arguments:{ firstname: "John" }
  });
  logger.info(JSON.stringify(result))

  await client.close();
  process.exit(0);
}

main().catch(logger.error);
```

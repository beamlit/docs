title: 'Develop a custom MCP server'

description: 'Create your own custom MCP Servers.'

---

You can **develop custom [MCP servers](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) in TypeScript** **or Python** and deploy them on Blaxel by integrating a few lines of the Blaxel SDK and leveraging our other developer tools ([Blaxel CLI](https://www.notion.so/cli-reference), GitHub action, etc.).

## Quickstart

<Warning>It is required to have *npm* (TypeScript) **or *uv* (Python) installed to use the following command.</Warning>

You can quickly **initialize a new MCP server from scratch** by using CLI command `bl create-mcp-server`. This will create a pre-scaffolded local repo where your entire code can be added.

```bash
bl create-mcp-server my-mcp
```

You can test it by running the following command which launches both the server and a web application ([MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector), managed by MCP) locally for testing the server’s capabilities during development. 

<CodeGroup>

```shell TypeScript

pnpm inspect

```

```shell Python
BL_DEBUG=true uv run mcp dev src/server.py

```

</CodeGroup>

The web application is accessible at: [http://127.0.0.1:6274](http://127.0.0.1:6274/). Alternatively, you can just simply serve the server locally by running `bl serve --hotreload`.

## Develop the MCP server logic (TypeScript)

If you open the `src/server.ts` file, you'll see the complete server implementation. It follows the MCP server standard closely, with the only difference being **our use of Blaxel transport** for efficient platform serving.

The main component you'll need to modify is the tool definition:

```typescript server.ts {12-24}

import { BlaxelMcpServerTransport, logger } from "@blaxel/sdk";
import { McpServer } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js";
import { StdioServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js";
import { z } from "zod";

const server = new McpServer({
  name: "mymcp",
  version: "1.0.0",
  description: ""
});

server.tool(
  "hello_world",
  "Say hello to a person",
  {
    firstname: z.string()
  },
  async ({firstname}) => {
    logger.info(`Hello world called`);
    return {
      content: [{ type: "text", text: `Hello ${firstname}` }]
    }
  }
);

function main() {
  let transport;
  if (process.env.BL_SERVER_PORT) {
    transport = new BlaxelMcpServerTransport();
  } else {
    transport = new StdioServerTransport();
  }
  server.connect(transport);
  logger.info("Server started");
}

main();

```

Remember that the `name`, `description`, and *parameters* are crucial—they help your agent understand how your tool functions.

## Develop the MCP server logic (Python)

If you open the `src/server.py` file, you'll see the complete server implementation. It follows the MCP server standard closely, with the only difference being **our use of Blaxel transport** for efficient platform serving.

The main component you'll need to modify is the tool definition:

```python server.py {10-18}

from blaxel import env
from blaxel.mcp.server import FastMCP

from typing import Annotated
from logging import getLogger

mcp = FastMCP("mcp-helloworld-python")
logger = getLogger(__name__)

@mcp.tool()
def hello_world(
    first_name: Annotated[
        str,
        "First name of the user",
    ],
) -> str:
    """Say hello to the user"""
    return f"Hello {first_name}!"

if not env["BL_DEBUG"]:
    mcp.run(transport="ws")

```

## Deploy your MCP server

Just run `bl deploy` in the folder of your project, as explained [in this guide](Deploy-a-function).

```bash
bl deploy
```

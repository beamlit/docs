## Install

Run the following command 

```shell TypeScript

npm install @blaxel

```

```shell Python

uv init && uv add blaxel

```

</CodeGroup>

This will install the following packages:

- in TypeScript:
    - @blaxel/core: functions to manage resources on Blaxel
    - @blaxel/telemetry: for automatic telemetry export to Blaxel
    - @blaxel/langgraph: to convert tools and agents to LangChain or LangGraph format
    - @blaxel/vercel: to convert tools and agents to Vercelâ€™s AI SDK format
    - @blaxel/mastra: to convert tools and agents to Mastra format
    - @blaxel/llamaindex: to convert tools and agents to LlamaIndex format

## How it works

The Blaxel SDK authenticates with your workspace using credentials from these sources, in priority order:

1. variables in your `.env` file (`BL_WORKSPACE` and `BL_API_KEY`, or see [this page](../Agents/Variables-and-secrets) for other authentication options)
2. environment variables from your machine
3. configuration file created locally when you log in through [Blaxel CLI](../cli-reference/introduction) (or deploy on Blaxel)

When developing locally, the recommended method is to just **log in to your workspace with Blaxel CLI.** This allows you to run Blaxel SDK functions that will automatically connect to your workspace without additional setup. When you deploy on Blaxel, this connection persists automatically.

When running Blaxel SDK from a remote server that is not Blaxel-hosted, we recommend using environment variables as described in the first option above.

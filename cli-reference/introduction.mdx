Beamlit CLI is a command line tool to interact with the Beamlit APIs.

## Install

<Warning>To install the Beamlit CLI, you must use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/): make sure it is installed on your machine. We are currently in the process of supporting additional installers. Please reach out to [support@beamlit.com](mailto:support@beamlit.com) if you need to use an alternative to Homebrew.</Warning>

Install the Beamlit CLI by running the following two commands successively in a terminal:

```bash
### Tap the Beamlit formula to Homebrew
brew tap beamlit/beamlit
```

```bash
### Install the Beamlit CLI using Homebrew
brew install beamlit
```

## Get started

To get started with the CLI, your must first create a [workspace](../Security/Workspace-access-control.md) on the Beamlit console. Then, login to Beamlit using the following command and replacing `your-workspace`:

```bash
beamlit login your-workspace
```

You will be prompted to finish login using either an [API key](../Security/Access-tokens.md), or through your browser.

Set a workspace to use as a context for the session by using the following command:

```bash
beamlit workspaces your-workspace

### Retrieve the list of workspaces you have access to by running:
beamlit workspaces
```

You can now run any command to interact with Beamlit resources in your workspace. For example, to list models:

```bash
beamlit get models
```

## **Options**

-w, --workspace string   Specify the Beamlit workspace to work on.

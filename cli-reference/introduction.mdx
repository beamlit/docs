## Get started

To get started with the CLI, your must first create a [workspace](../Security/Workspace-access-control) on the Beamlit console. Then, login to Beamlit using the following command and replacing `your-workspace`:

```bash
bl login your-workspace
```

You will be prompted to finish login using either an [API key](../Security/Access-tokens), or through your browser.

Set a workspace to use as a context for the session by using the following command:

```bash
bl workspaces your-workspace

### You can retrieve the list of all your workspaces by running:
bl workspaces
```

You can now run any command to interact with Beamlit resources in your workspace. For example, to list agents:

```bash
bl get agents
```

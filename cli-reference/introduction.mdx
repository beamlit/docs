## Get started

To get started with the CLI, your must first create a [workspace](../Security/Workspace-access-control.mdx) on the Beamlit console. Then, login to Beamlit using the following command and replacing `your-workspace`:

```bash
beamlit login your-workspace
```

You will be prompted to finish login using either an [API key](../Security/Access-tokens.mdx), or through your browser.

Set a workspace to use as a context for the session by using the following command:

```bash
beamlit workspaces your-workspace

### Retrieve the list of workspaces you have access to by running:
beamlit workspaces
```

You can now run any command to interact with Beamlit resources in your workspace. For example, to list models:

```bash
beamlit get models
```

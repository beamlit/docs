For the most reliable solution, we recommend adapting the aforementioned Linux commands by using Windows Subsystem for Linux.

 

First install WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) if not already installed. This can be done by:

- Opening PowerShell as Administrator
- Running: `wsl --install -d Ubuntu-20.04`
- Restarting the computer
- From the Microsoft Store, install the Ubuntu app
- Run the command line using the aforementioned Linux installation process. Make sure to install using **sudo**.

## Get started

To get started with Blaxel CLI, your must first create a [workspace](../Security/Workspace-access-control) on the Blaxel console. Then, login to Blaxel using the following command and replacing `your-workspace`:

```bash
bl login your-workspace
```

You will be prompted to finish login using either an [API key](../Security/Access-tokens), or through your browser.

Set a workspace to use as a context for the session by using the following command:

```bash
bl workspaces your-workspace

### You can retrieve the list of all your workspaces by running:
bl workspaces
```

You can now run any command to interact with Blaxel resources in your workspace. For example, to list agents:

```bash
bl get agents
```

## **Options**

```
-h, --help               Get the help for Blaxel
-w, --workspace string   Specify the Blaxel workspace to work on.
-o, --output string      Output format. One of: pretty, yaml, json, table
-v, --verbose            Enable verbose output
```

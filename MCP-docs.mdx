Blaxel provides an MCP server that you can install locally in your coding assistant (Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Desktop, etc.).

This MCP server connects directly to this documentation, ensuring your coding assistant receives real-time information about available commands and features.

## Install the MCP server

The MCP server for Blaxel documentation is called “**beamlit**”. Open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npx @mintlify/mcp@latest add beamlit 
```

Everything will be set up automatically.

Blaxel provides an **MCP server** that you can install locally in your coding assistant (Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Desktop, etc.). This MCP server connects directly to this documentation, ensuring your coding assistant receives real-time information about available commands and features.

## Install the MCP server

Open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npx mint-mcp add blaxel
```

Everything will be set up automatically.

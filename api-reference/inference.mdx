title: 'Inference API'

description: 'Run inferences on your Blaxel deployments.'

---

Whenever you deploy a workload on Blaxel, an **inference endpoint** is generated on Global Inference Network, the [infrastructure powerhouse](../Models/Global-Inference-Network) that hosts it.

The inference API URL depends on the type of workload ([agent](../Agents/Overview%2015347e47b1ea807bbba6d269c01e633d), [model API](../Models/Overview%2015347e47b1ea80f48cbcd345aafd924a), [function](../Functions/Overview)) you are trying to request:

<CodeGroup>

```http Query agent

POST run.blaxel.ai/{YOUR-WORKSPACE}/agents/{YOUR-AGENT}

```

```http Query model API

POST run.blaxel.ai/{your-workspace}/models/{your-model}

```

```markdown Query function

run.blaxel.ai/{YOUR-WORKSPACE}/functions/{YOUR-FUNCTION}

```

</CodeGroup>

Showing the full request, with the input payload:

<CodeGroup>

```http Query agent

curl -X POST "https://run.blaxel.ai/{your-workspace}/agents/{your-agent}" \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H "X-Blaxel-Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>" \
-d '{"inputs":"Hello, world!"}'

```

```http Query model API (example on a chat completion model)
curl -X POST "run.blaxel.ai/{your-workspace}/models/{your-model}/chat/completions" \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H "X-Blaxel-Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>" \
-d '{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello!"}]}'

```

```http Query function (custom functions only)
curl -X POST "run.blaxel.ai/{your-workspace}/functions/{your-function}/tools/call" \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H "X-Blaxel-Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>" \
-d $'{"inputs":"Enter your input here."}'

```

</CodeGroup>

### Manage sessions

To simulate multi-turn conversations, you can include a thread ID in your agent request header. You'll need to generate this ID and pass it using either `X-Blaxel-Thread-Id` or `Thread-Id`. Without a thread ID, the agent won't maintain nor use any conversation memory when processing the request.

This is only available for agent requests.

```http Query agent with thread ID

curl -X POST "https://run.blaxel.ai/{your-workspace}/agents/{your-agent}" \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H "X-Blaxel-Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>" \
-H "X-Blaxel-Thread-Id: <THREAD_ID>" \
-d '{"inputs":"Hello, world!"}'

```

### Invoke pre-built functions

**Pre-built functions** are [Model Context Protocol](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol) (MCP) servers deployed on Blaxel. They provide a toolkit of multiple toolsâ€”individual capabilities for accessing specific APIs or databases. These functions can be interacted using WebSocket protocol. 

Read more about [how to call pre-built functions in this documentation](../Functions/Invoke-functions).

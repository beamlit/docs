Whenever you deploy a model on Beamlit, an **inference endpoint** is generated on Global Inference Network.

The inference URL looks like this:

`run.beamlit.com/{your-workspace}/models/{your-model}`

There is one distinct endpoint for each **model deployment,** i.e. for each combination of a [model](../Models/Model-deployment.md) and an [environment](../Model-Governance/Environments.md) on which it is deployed. 

For example, if you have one version of model “your-model” deployed on the *production* environment and one version deployed on the *development* environment:

- `run.beamlit.com/{your-workspace}/models/{your-model}?environment=production` will call the production deployment

- `run.beamlit.com/{your-workspace}/models/{your-model}?environment=development` will call the development deployment

If you do not specify the environment in the inference request, it will call the *production* environment by default. If the model is not deployed on the production environment, it will return an error.

**Beamlit Integrations** enable you to equip your agents with tools that access various external APIs, private networks and AI services. This unified interface allows you to **manage access control, credentials, and observability** across different providers and systems from a single platform.

Beamlit supports integration with leading LLM providers like OpenAI and Anthropic, as well as custom model deployment through HuggingFace, giving you powerful AI capabilities with minimal setup.

All integrations must be configured by a workspace admin in the Integrations section of the workspace settings before they can be used by team members.

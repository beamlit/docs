**Blaxel Integrations** enable you to equip your [agents](Agents/Overview) with tools that access various external APIs, private networks and AI services, and to connect them to downstream interfaces such as your applications. With integrations, you can **manage access control, credentials, and observability** across different providers and systems from a single platform.

Blaxel supports integration with:

- leading LLM providers like OpenAI or Anthropic
- APIs and SaaS for agentsâ€™ tools like Slack or GitHub
- downstream marketplaces like Pactory

All integrations must be configured by a [workspace admin](Security/Workspace-access-control) in the Integrations section of the workspace settings before they can be used by team members.

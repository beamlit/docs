**Beamlit Integrations** enable you to equip your [agents](Agents/Overview) with tools that access various external APIs, private networks and AI services. This unified interface allows you to **manage access control, credentials, and observability** across different providers and systems from a single platform.

Beamlit supports integration with leading LLM providers like OpenAI and Anthropic, APIs and SaaS for agentsâ€™ tools like Slack or GitHub, as well as custom model deployment through HuggingFace. All integrations must be configured by a [workspace admin](Security/Workspace-access-control) in the Integrations section of the workspace settings before they can be used by team members.

# Core features

## Connect with a model on Blaxel

We provide an helper, to avoid managing connection with the model on Blaxel by yourself.

```ts
import { blModel } from "@blaxel/sdk";

const model = await blModel("BlaxelModelName").toLlamaIndex();
```

You just retrieve it by name, available from blaxel UI
You will be able to convert it to the framework you want to use.

Available frameworks :
- LlamaIndex : toLlamaIndex
- VercelAI : toVercelAI
- LangChain : toLangChain


## Connect with a tool

While you can deploy a MCP server on blaxel, and create your own, you wan't to be able to consume them easily from an agent.

```ts
import { blTools } from "@blaxel/sdk";

const tools = await blTools(['mcpServerName']).ToVercelAI();
```

Same as the model, you can use it with the framework you want.

Available frameworks :
- VercelAI : toVercelAI
- LangChain : toLangChain
- LlamaIndex : toLlamaIndex

## Connect to another agent

For agent chaining, you can do it the standard way for each framework, and create only one deployment, doing everything.
At Blaxel, we have made a bet on two things :
- Agent could become really big, and monolothic is not a good solution for long term maintenance.
- An atomic agent could be use in multiple agent project

So we allow directly a microservice architecture for agent chaining, and you can call an agent from another agent, instead of puting everything on the same code.

```ts
import { blAgent } from "@blaxel/sdk";

const myFirstAgentResponse = await blAgent("firstAgent").run(input);
const mySecondAgentResponse = await blAgent("secondAgent").run(myFirstAgentResponse);
```

So you can create your own workflow with agents.


## Instrumentation

We provide an automatic instrumentation, and a logger to help you debug and monitor your agent.

To enable it, you just have to require the sdk at root level of your project.

```ts
import "@blaxel/sdk";
```

It will automatically enable everything when deployed on Blaxel.

If you want to put custom log and see them in the Blaxel UI, you will have to use our logger.

```ts
import { logger } from "@blaxel/sdk";

logger.info("Hello, world!");
```

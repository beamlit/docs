# Core features

## Connect with a model on Blaxel

We provide an helper, to avoid managing connection with the model on Blaxel by yourself.

```ts
import { blModel } from "@blaxel/sdk";

const model = await blModel("BlaxelModelName").toLlamaIndex();
```

You just retrieve it by name, available from blaxel UI
You will be able to convert it to the framework you want to use.

Available frameworks :
- LlamaIndex : toLlamaIndex
- VercelAI : toVercelAI
- LangChain : toLangChain


## Connect with a tool

While you can deploy a MCP server on blaxel, and create your own, you wan't to be able to consume them easily from an agent.

```ts
import { blTools } from "@blaxel/sdk";

const tools = await blTools(['mcpServerName']).ToVercelAI();
```

Same as the model, you can use it with the framework you want.

Available frameworks :
- VercelAI : toVercelAI
- LangChain : toLangChain
- LlamaIndex : toLlamaIndex

## Connect to another agent

For agent chaining, you can do it the standard way for each framework, and create only one deployment, doing everything.
At Blaxel, we have made a bet on two things :
- Agent could become really big, and monolothic is not a good solution for long term maintenance.
- An atomic agent could be use in multiple agent project

So we allow directly a microservice architecture for agent chaining, and you can call an agent from another agent, instead of puting everything on the same code.

```ts
import { blAgent } from "@blaxel/sdk";

const myFirstAgentResponse = await blAgent("firstAgent").run(input);
const mySecondAgentResponse = await blAgent("secondAgent").run(myFirstAgentResponse);
```

So you can create your own workflow with agents.


## Instrumentation

We provide an automatic instrumentation, and a logger to help you debug and monitor your agent.

To enable it, you just have to require the sdk at root level of your project.

```ts
import "@blaxel/sdk";
```

It will automatically enable everything when deployed on Blaxel.

If you want to put custom log and see them in the Blaxel UI, you will have to use our logger.

```ts
import { logger } from "@blaxel/sdk";

logger.info("Hello, world!");
```

## Root of your project

On top of your project, you will have different files (it can be generated throught the bl create-agent-app command) :

### package.json
Required for any typescript or javascript project on the platform


The main entrypoint we read for deploy and serve your project will be in the package.json file.

```json
// For example this is the minimal package.json you need to have
// The start command will be launch with bl serve, and bl deploy artifact used for deployment
"scripts": {
  "start": "node src/index.js"
}
```
You can add other scripts with different usages :
- `dev` : If you add this script, it will be used when you run `bl serve --hotreload`
-> By default, we use `tsx watch src/index.ts` with ts code, which allow a live reload when you edit your code
- `build` : If you add this script, it will be call during the build of the artifact, allowing you to run your code in production already builded.
-> By default, we use `tsc` to compile your code
- `prod` : If set it will be used as the command in the production environment, it allow to use a different command when you dev locally with `bl serve` which will use the start script, and the prod, which will use this one.


A complete example can be this :
```json
  "scripts": {
    "start": "tsx src/index.ts",
    "prod": "node dist/index.js",
    "dev": "tsx watch src/index.ts",
    "build": "tsc"
  },
```

### blaxel.toml

This file is optional, and allow you to define your project configuration.

```toml
name = "myproject"
workspace = "myworkspace"
type = "function"

agents = ["anotheragent"]
functions = ["atool"]
models = ["amodel"]

[env]
DEFAULT_CITY = "San Francisco"
```

`name` and `workspace` are not required, but allow you to force the current project to be deploy with these informations, without thinking about it after (if you have multiple workspace for example)
`type` is optional, but default value will be `agent`, it need to be set to `function` if you want to deploy an MCP server.

`agents` `functions` and `models` are optional, that allow you to create a cache for the resource your link in your project.
If not set, it will cache the whole workspace resources, this cache is refresh every time you do a `bl deploy` or `bl serve` command.
This cache is intended to avoid call between your agent or mcp server and our controlplane, in case of missing cache, we fallback, but it slower to boot in serverless mode.

`[env]` is optional, and allow you to define environment variables for your project.
This variables should not be secrets.

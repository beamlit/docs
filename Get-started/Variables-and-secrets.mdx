# Variables
You can define variables inside your agent or MCP server in the `blaxel.toml` file at root level of your project.
These variables are not intended to be use as secrets, more as configuration variables.

```toml
name = "..."
workspace = "..."
type = "function"

[env]
DEFAULT_CITY = "San Francisco"

```

You can then use it in your code with the `env.DEFAULT_CITY` variable.

```ts
const { env } = require("@blaxel/sdk");
const myVariable = env.DEFAULT_CITY;
```

# Secrets
You can create another file name ".env" at root level of your project, and put your secrets in it.
These variables should not be committed, it should be in your .gitignore file.

```
MY_SECRET_VARIABLE=mySecretValue
```

You can then use it in your code with the `env.MY_SECRET_VARIABLE` variable.

```ts
const { env } = require("@blaxel/sdk");
const mySecretVariable = env.MY_SECRET_VARIABLE;
```
